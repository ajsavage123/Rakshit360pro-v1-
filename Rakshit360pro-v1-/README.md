- **Session Management** with PostgreSQL backing

### External APIs
- **Google Gemini AI** for medical consultations
- **Geoapify API** for hospital search and geocoding
- **OpenStreetMap** APIs for fallback hospital data

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database (Neon recommended)
- Google Gemini API keys
- Geoapify API key (optional, for enhanced hospital search)

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
VITE_GEOAPIFY_API_KEY=your_geoapify_api_key
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajsavage123/RAKSHITH360ultimate.git
cd RAKSHITH360ultimate
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Set up the database**
```bash
npm run db:push
```

4. **Start the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### API Key Configuration

The application uses a 4-key rotation system for Google Gemini API:

1. On first launch, you'll be prompted to enter your API keys
2. Keys are stored securely in localStorage
3. The system automatically cycles between keys when quotas are exceeded
4. Default keys are pre-configured for immediate testing

To get Google Gemini API keys:
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add multiple keys for better quota management

## Usage

2. **Start Conversation**: Describe your medical concerns
3. **Follow Questions**: Answer AI-generated follow-up questions
4. **Get Analysis**: Receive comprehensive medical summary
5. **Find Hospitals**: View nearby hospitals based on recommended specialty

### Flash Mode
1. **Quick Access**: Click the Flash Mode button
2. **Emergency Input**: Describe your emergency situation briefly
3. **Instant Analysis**: Get immediate medical guidance including:
